# CodeAlpha_Sudoku_Solver

This repository contains a Sudoku solver implemented in C++. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution to a given Sudoku puzzle. It is capable of solving puzzles of varying difficulty levels.

## Description

The Sudoku solver program reads a Sudoku board, solves it using a backtracking algorithm, and prints the solved board. The Sudoku board is represented as a 9x9 grid where `0` denotes an empty cell.

## How It Works

1. **Validation**: The `isValid` function checks if placing a number in a specific cell is valid according to Sudoku rules.
2. **Solving**: The `solveSudoku` function uses recursion and backtracking to fill the board with numbers.
3. **Printing**: The `printBoard` function formats the board for easy reading.

## Usage

To use the Sudoku solver:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sudoku-solver
   
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o sudoku_solver sudoku_solver.cpp
   

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./sudoku_solver
   

## Example
The provided code includes a sample Sudoku puzzle. When you run the program, it will output the solved Sudoku board.
